# Weight Agnostic Neural Networks with Structural Metrics modification

Active prototype and computational experiment already available in Colab. [![Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1GpI58LDkbdWZm-H93AVnV9oqJLFWDJZ_)

All experiments mentioned in paper are located in [this](https://github.com/MakhmoodSodikov/symbolic_regression/blob/master/WANN_modif.py) Notebook.

WANNs core modification with NEAT-algo is available [here](https://github.com/MakhmoodSodikov/symbolic_regression/blob/master/WANN_modif.py
) (_TODO_).

Presentation of our research can be seen [here](https://github.com/MakhmoodSodikov/symbolic_regression/blob/master/WANN_presentation.pdf).
